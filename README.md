# 100_days_dataviz
Making a new data visualization every day for 100 days in an attempt to improve my data viz skills and build a portfolio. 


Day 1: I went to Tableau https://www.tableau.com/data-sets-students for datasets and found a cool one called the Cost of Higher Education in the US. It's hosted by Kaggle and is a pretty big data set. It may have been because I had too many tabs open, but Tableau was being very slow in connecting datasets. I wanted to chart out the average cost of school per year from 1996-2013. I was afraid I wouldn't have anything done before my time was up, so instead of comparing every year to each other, I just decided to compare the years 1996, 2006, and 2013. I'm thinking that Tableau may be good with pre-processed data. Maybe slicing up the data and only giving Tableau the columns I want to use may not drag everything to a crawl. Tableau is so bulky that it took more time to load in and join the data then it did to actually make the visualizations. So many times Tableau is "not responding." I only have this trial for 14 days. I'm a little worried most of that time will be spent waiting on Tableau to function.  This was what I was able to come up with in 2 hours. I did end up closing all my tabs and extra programs, but it didn't help poor Tablea.
